# To-Do List App (Now You're Adulting)

Welcome to the most dangerously productive tool that runs in your terminal. 
This To-Do List app helps you remember things "before your boss does!". 
Add tasks, check tasks, remove tasks — all while pretending you’re hacking The Matrix.

##  Features
-  Add tasks like "Buy milk" or "Build billion-dollar startup"
-  View all your bad decisions (a.k.a. tasks)
-  Remove the ones you’re never going to do anyway
-  Your list is saved automatically (because we believe in second chances)

##  How to Launch Your Empire
 Save the script as `todo.py`
 Open your terminal (or VS Code)
 start typing
