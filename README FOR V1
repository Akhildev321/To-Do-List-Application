This is a simple Python console application that helps you manage a list of tasks using the terminal. 
You can view, add, and remove tasks — and your to-do list is saved to a file so you don’t lose it when you close the app.

 **Features**
View all your tasks
Add new tasks
Remove tasks by number
Tasks are saved in a text file (tasks.txt) so they're always there next time

**How to Run this** 
Make sure you have Python installed.
Save the file as todo.py.
Run the script in terminal or VS Code
Keep the app in the same folder as tasks.txt. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically.
